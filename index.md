My name is Amirhossein Tavakoli, and I am a PhD Candidate at the [UBC's Vancouver School of Economics](https://economics.ubc.ca/). My research interests are in Innovation, Public Economics, and Labor Economics. In my job market paper, I study skilled-biased technological change at innovative firms exploiting an R&D tax credit in Canada.<br>

#### I am available for interviews in the 2024-2025 job market.

<b>Innovative Firms and Skill-Biased Technological Change: Evidence from an R&D Tax Credit</b> </p>

<p style="margin-top:0.5em" align="justify">
Innovative firms contribute to economic growth, create higher-paying jobs, and hire a disproportionately larger share of high-skill workers. I study how innovative firms change their worker composition when they increase their R&D expenditure.</p>

<b>Job Transitions and Employee Earnings After Acquisitions: Linking Corporate and Worker Outcomes</b>, with David Arnold, Kevin Milligan, Terry Moon </p>

This paper connects changes in employer characteristics through job transitions to employee earnings following mergers and acquisitions. Using firm balance sheet data linked to individual earnings data in Canada and a matched difference-in-differences design, we find that earnings of workers at target firms decrease after M&As, largely driven by those who move to other firms. Workers leaving targets move to larger and more profitable firms, but experience wage declines potentially due to a loss of firm-specific human capital or backloaded contracts. It appears that losses of match-specific premiums from job transitions primarily explain the post-M&A earnings decline in our setting.

<b>Corporate Acquisitions and Investment: Evidence from Europe</b> with David Arnold and Terry Moon </p>
<details><summary>Abstract | <a href="https://amirhosseintavakoli.github.io/assets/pdfs/CAI_draft.pdf" target="_blank">Paper</a></summary>

This paper assesses how corporate M&As affect firms’ investment in long-term capital. Using financial data (2009 – 2018) for 10 European countries, we compare firms that went through M&As with similar non-M&A firms before and after the events. We find that acquirers significantly decreased their fixed assets after M&As and that the reduction was not driven by reallocation between merging parties or across different types of assets. Heterogeneity analyses based on industries reveal that the decline in investment was unlikely driven by the market power channel. Instead, acquirers appear to reduce long-term assets and increase debts to finance their acquisitions.

<b>What do one hundred million transactions tell us about demand elasticity of gasoline?</b>, with Mohammad Vesal, Mohammad H. Rahmati </p>

The price elasticity of gasoline demand is a key parameter in evaluating various policies. However, most of the literature uses aggregate data to identify this elasticity. Temporal and spatial aggregation make such elasticity estimates biased. We employ a unique dataset of all gasoline transactions in Iran during a 4-month period around an unexpected exogenous price change to identify that price elasticity. We also identify a significant withholding behaviour by consumers in response to anticipated price changes. The consumers reduce or postpone their purchases when they expect a price decrease. Controlling for date fixed effects would eliminate homogeneous withholding responses. However, heterogeneous responses to this anticipated price change would lead to overestimating price elasticity. After controlling for date, individual, and location fixed effects as well as the withholding behaviour, we estimate a robust significant price elasticity of − 0.085. Aggregation of the same data by week, month, and city yields an estimate of − 0.3, indicating a significant bias in earlier studies.</p>
